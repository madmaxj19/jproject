Have you ever wondered how map overlays for Google Maps are created? In the project for this course you will build your own interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information. Both powerful and challenging, data visualization is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day!

To create this project, you’ll be working with a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations. It was developed by Till Nagel and the team at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam along with other contributors and we are grateful that they developed such a cool package that we (and you) can build on for this course.

The project is separated into several parts, and you will be able to achieve project milestones as you work through the modules in the course. Throughout the project, we’ve suggested extensions and ideas for adding extra features to your project. Have fun with it and make it your own. At the end of the course, you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your creation and see what your peers have built too.

Learning outcomes:
Build an interactive graphical program in Java
Design classes to make use of object-oriented programming paradigms
Explain inheritance and polymorphism and how each concept is applied in the creation of a Java GUI
Explain how event handling works in Java, and write event handlers to create an interactive program
Write and apply searching and sorting algorithms to manage large data sets
Find and fix errors (bugs) in code
Develop and use test cases to ensure correctness of a program

We are extremely grateful to Till Nagel and the team at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam and all other contributors to Unfolding Maps, a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations. (http://unfoldingmaps.org/)

As part of this package, the SQLite library (version 3.7.2) is included. We gratefully acknowledge xerial.org for creating this Java library (https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/) and D. Richard Hipp for the development of SQLite.
